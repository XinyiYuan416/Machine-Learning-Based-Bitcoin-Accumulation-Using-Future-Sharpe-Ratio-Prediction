    "# Step 1: Feature Engineering - The Foundation of Everything\n",
    "# ----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "# This step determines the upper bound of model performance.\n",
    "# All features must be non-forward-looking (i.e., only based on information available up to time t).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Price-Derived Features:\n",
    "# - Momentum: Past N-day returns (e.g., 7, 30, 90), Sharpe ratio over past N days.\n",
    "# - Volatility: Historical volatility (e.g., 20-day rolling std), ATR (Average True Range).\n",
    "# - Trend Strength: ADX (Average Directional Index), deviation from moving averages (e.g., Close / SMA(200)).\n",
    "# - Relative Position: Quantile of current price in rolling window ((Close - Min(90)) / (Max(90) - Min(90))).\n",
    "\n",
    "# On-Chain Data:\n",
    "# - SOPR: Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR < 1 often signals a good entry point).\n",
    "# - MVRV Z-Score: MVRV Z < 0 often indicates market bottom zone.\n",
    "# - Network Activity: Active addresses, number of transactions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Macro & Sentiment Features:\n",
    "# - Fear & Greed Index\n",
    "# - DXY (Dollar Index), S&P 500 returns and volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "# Feature Transformations:\n",
    "# - Z-score standardization\n",
    "# - First and second differences (e.g., delta, acceleration)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Final Output: For each day t, compute a feature vector X_t\n",
    "# Step 2: Label Definition - Teaching the Model What to Learn\n",
    "# -----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "# Each X_t should have a corresponding y_t label, representing the \"desirability\" of buying at time t.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Label A: Future Price Reversal (Regression)\n",
    "# y_t = - (future_price_N_days / current_price - 1)\n",
    "# Goal: Encourage model to buy before price increases (negative label = good buy).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Label B: Future Lowest Price Index (Multi-class Classification)\n",
    "# y_t = argmin(future_prices_over_N_days)\n",
    "# Goal: Predict the day in the next N days that represents the local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Label C: Future Sharpe Ratio (Recommended, Regression)\n",
    "# y_t = mean(future_N_day_returns) / std(future_N_day_returns)\n",
    "# Goal: Predict risk-adjusted return; identifies low-volatility, high-return buy points.\n",
    "# Step 3: Model Selection and Training\n",
    "# ------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Model Choice:\n",
    "# - Gradient Boosting Trees (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost): Strongly recommended for tabular data.\n",
    "#   Pros: Handles missing values, regularization, interpretable, fast.\n",
    "# - Time Series Models (LSTM, Transformer): Advanced, captures long-term dependencies. Needs more data & tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Walk-Forward Validation (Time Series Friendly Training)\n",
    "# - Sort data chronologically.\n",
    "# - Loop training as follows:\n",
    "#     1. Train: Use initial window (e.g., 2016â€“2020) to train LightGBM.\n",
    "#     2. Predict: Predict next short period (e.g., Jan 2021) using model.\n",
    "#     3. Store: Save predicted scores y_pred.\n",
    "#     4. Slide window: Move training window forward by one month.\n",
    "#     5. Repeat until entire backtest period is covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Result: Daily y_pred sequence aligned with price data for the full period.\n",
    "# Step 4: Weight Transformation & Backtesting\n",
    "# -------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Signal Processing:\n",
    "# - Convert raw y_pred into positive signal scores.\n",
    "# - Use Sigmoid or modified Softmax:\n",
    "#   raw_signal = 1 / (1 + exp(-y_pred))\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Rolling Window Normalization:\n",
    "# - For each 365-day evaluation window:\n",
    "#   weights = raw_signals / sum(raw_signals)\n",
    "# - (Optional) Add small epsilon to ensure strictly positive weights:\n",
    "#   raw_signals += epsilon\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Metric Computation:\n",
    "# - Use weights and prices to calculate metrics for each window:\n",
    "#   - SPD (Signal-Weighted Price Delta)\n",
    "#   - SPD Percentile\n",
    "#   - Win Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "# - Final Score: Average across all rolling windows.\n"
